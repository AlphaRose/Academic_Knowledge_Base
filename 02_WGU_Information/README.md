# Purpose

This section exists for everything that is **WGU specific**.

Not course content.  
Not general notes.  
Not assignments.


If there’s something about WGU’s structure, policies, systems, tools, pacing, or evaluation style that affects how I move through the program, I placed it here.

# Why This Matters

WGU operates differently than traditional programs.

It’s self paced.  
It’s competency based.  
It rewards planning and structure.

Understanding the system improves performance inside the system.
